Her passion for driving positive change is evident in the equity initiatives she has successfully organized and implemented to benefit frontline community members in Denver and Boulder County. She has succeeded in connecting under-resourced communities to sustainability programs to advance climate action and equity, for example, in launching Longmont's first equitable sustainable business program and leading a strategy aiding Equity Priority buildings in meeting the Energize Denver Buildings Performance Ordinance.
