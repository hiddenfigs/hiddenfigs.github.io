  "bio": "Radna Segal was born in 1991 in an ethnically diverse area of Southern Russia called Kamykia, where she was influenced by both Asian and European cultures.\nShe currently lives and works in Boulder, Colorado in the United States.\nHer textural, three-dimensional paintings feature dynamic composition and various experimental materials like plaster, foil, paint, glitter, and beads which create organic movement inspired by nature. Within her pieces, she uses an ancient, rare, and ornate Mongolian writing called “clear script,” that very few in the world know how to create.",
