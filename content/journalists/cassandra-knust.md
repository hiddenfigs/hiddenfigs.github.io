  "bio": "Originally from the Houston, Texas region, I moved to Colorado in 2020 as the pandemic hit our communities.\n\nIn 2018, I graduated from Sam Houston State University with a degree in Broadcast Journalism and Criminal Justice. I began my journalism career as a newspaper reporter in Montrose, Colorado in 2020, where I built a foundation in local journalism for two years. I joined the KVNF news team in January 2023, where I've had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of our rural region through radio.",
