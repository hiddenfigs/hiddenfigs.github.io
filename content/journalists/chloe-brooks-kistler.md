  "bio": "I'm Chloe Brooks-Kistler, an experienced, award-winning audio journalist. I have a BA in Political Science and Italian Studies from Colorado College, and I am passionate about telling stories through audio. Starting at 16, I have worked with NPR affiliate 91.5 KRCC in the past, voicing PSAs and editing stories for reporters and my own creations.\n\nIn college, I produced a podcast called The 719 Perspective for the growing media hub Dailydose719. I spoke with members of the community ranging from the former mayor to the president of my college, to a local student leading a protest against the city\u2019s largest school district. I also produced a podcast called S\u00ec, esistiamo: Podcasts Centering the Experiences of Afroitalians, a podcast created to bring light to the injustices of the Italian citizenship laws. I presented this podcast at the 2022 Colorado College Summer Research Symposium and the 2023 CPC Africana/Women and Gender Studies Conference at Franklin & Marshall College, in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\nI have been recognized for my work in the podcasting/journalism world. I won the 2023 John C. Ensslin Memorial Scholarship awarded by the Denver Press Club, the oldest press club in the country. I am also the inaugural winner of the Adrienne Lanier Seward Bold and Courageous Actions Award for 2023, awarded by President L. Song Richardson of Colorado College.\n\nI believe in the power of stories to move and inspire people. With my passion and expertise, I produce podcasts that explore complex topics and provide unique perspectives. I will continue to create content that celebrates diverse and underrepresented stories. Whether I\u2019m producing a podcast or working behind the scenes, my goal is always the same: to amplify the accounts of those who have been unheard.",
