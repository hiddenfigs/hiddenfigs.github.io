  "bio": "I’m the State Capitol Reporter at KUNC, which means I help make sense of the latest developments at the Colorado State Capitol. I cover the legislature, the governor, and government agencies. My work as a reporter has always been about practical, responsible journalism. But there’s also more to it than that, especially these days. Fact-based journalism about elected officials, elections, and government policy helps us participate in our democracy. It also holds those in power to account. I’m also a firm believer in public radio as an accessible way to empower the public with reporting. Public radio stations go a long way in keeping the news independent and free for everyone.",
