  "bio": "Gloria Neal has over 30 years of experience as a business consultant, facilitator, moderator, emcee and public speaking coach. Gloria is considered a subject matter specialist for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I), as well as Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) training. Gloria’s successful track record is derived from working with many organizations from city and state agencies to for-profit and nonprofit organizations.  Gloria’s success consists of a combination of working side-by-side with leadership teams and implementing tangible goals within the space of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), which address today’s changing work environment.\n\nWhen GloKnows is on your team, you have a strong ally whose moral compass is centered and focused on achieving the goals of diversity, equity and inclusion. With firsthand knowledge of working in an environment which lacked a DE&I plan, Gloria is your go-to consultant to help prevent the challenges associated with employee turn-over.\n\nYou may have seen Gloria on television as a news anchor on CBS46 in Atlanta or a news reporter on CBS4 in Denver.  She has also been on Newsradio 850 KOA as a reporter, anchor and talk show host. These unique opportunities have better prepared Gloria on how best to leverage the power of words, and to ensure underrepresented populations have a voice and a seat at the table.\n\nMore recently, Gloria was recruited to join the mayor’s team as the Director of Public Affairs for the City and County of Denver under Michael B. Hancock’s administration. In this public-facing role, Gloria was a key member of the leadership team focusing on messaging, public policy, constituent services and speaking on the mayor’s behalf — all highlighting the administration’s focus on being equitable, inclusive and innovative.\n\nGloria graduated from the ESG/CSR Program at the University of Colorado (CU), Boulder, LEEDS Center for Corporate Social Responsibility (CCSR) receiving her certification. Gloria has also attended Cornell University’s Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Program. She is not new to the CU family having attended the University of Colorado, the Springs campus graduating with a BSBA in Marketing.  In addition, Gloria has a minor in Communications/Mass Media from Pikes Peak Community College (PPCC), Colorado Springs where she was honored to be selected for the PPCC Wall of Fame after graduation.\n\nIn her spare time, Gloria enjoys spending time with her husband, family and friends. She also enjoys attending shows at the performing arts complex at the DCPA, live concerts and music festivals, all sporting events and working out.",
