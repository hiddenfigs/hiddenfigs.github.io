  "bio": "The “American Dream” was coined in 1931 and since then the phrase has inspired people to work hard and dream big. But is it achievable today? Graduating from college is challenging, jobs are changing, and health care and basic rights can be a luxury. An award-winning journalist, I report on the barriers people face and overcome to succeed and create a better life for themselves and their families. I also created and host the KUNC podcast, The Colorado Dream.",
