  "bio": "Renata Hill is a Colorado neighbor who struggles with mental illness and neurodivergence. She is proudly Indigenous (Mvskoke) on her mother's side. Lived experience has provided her with a deep understanding of the strife created by adverse childhood experiences, generational trauma and marginalization. Plus, she's lost relatives, friends and colleagues to suicide. So, supporting people in recovery from trauma and despair has become her Why.\n\nWith fierce determination and the support of like-minded community members, she publishes Moodfuel to increase mental health equity and access to care by offering inclusive, solutions-based news and resources for neighbors who struggle.",
