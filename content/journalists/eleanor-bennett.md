  "bio": "I am a reporter and \"Morning Edition\" anchor at Aspen Public Radio. My reporting has been featured on NPR and I've received several statewide, regional and national awards including a 2023 Regional Edward R. Murrow Award. I've reported on a wide range of topics in my community, including the impacts of federal immigration policies on local DACA recipients, creative solutions to the affordable housing crisis, and hungry goats fighting climate change across the West. Connecting with people from all walks of life and creating empathic spaces for them to tell their stories fuels my work.",
