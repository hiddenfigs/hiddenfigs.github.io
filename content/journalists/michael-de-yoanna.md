  "bio": "Whether you live in a mansion or have no home at all, the most valuable thing you possess is your story.\n\n\n\nWith more than two decades of experience, I am a seasoned editor in chief and investigative reporter. Now at Colorado Community Media, one of the largest hyper-local news organizations in the United States, I lead an award-winning team of about 20 editors and reporters (and a cadre of freelancers) who produce 80-100 stories each week, covering local government, accountability, breaking news, enterprise, elections, business and more. We reach more than 350,000 readers in the cities, towns, suburbs and rural communities that make up the metro area surrounding Denver.\n\n\n\nThe focal points of my own career as an editor and reporter have been investigative and military journalism. My stories have prompted change, even new laws. I have received three dozen statewide, regional and national awards over the years, many for investigative stories.  My national investigative awards include a duPont-Columbia silver baton, three Associated Press Television-Radio Association awards, two Edward R. Murrows and a Sigma Delta Chi (Society of Professional Journalists).",
