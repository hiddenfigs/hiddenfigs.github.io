  "bio": "Shavonne Blades grew up on the West Coast but moved to Colorado in High School. She left for California after school and returned to Colorado in 1990. She got her start in media at the age of 21 in Santa Cruz, California as an advertising sales rep. Having no experience and nothing more than a couple of years as an art college attendee she felt the bug to work in media at a young age. She learned that by helping her customers with design and marketing, their campaigns would be far more successful and has made a 30+ year career in design, copywriting, and marketing for her clients. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPy4MMdcfLg. \n\nShe has always chosen to work in Independent Media and believes deeply in the need for true, authentic Community Journalism. She is proud that YS has never compromised journalism standards in its 20+ history and continues to print YS on paper monthly while also expanding web coverage. She has worked at 3 Alternative Weeklies and founded Yellow Scene Magazine in 2000. \n\nYou can learn more about Shavonne's adventures in the YS 20th Anniversary issue: https://yellowscene.com/2020/10/08/the-yellow-scenes-red-tornado/\n\nWï»¿ork examples: \\\nhttps://yellowscene.com/2022/11/14/andy-was-there-for-me-when-it-was-dark, https://yellowscene.com/2019/02/27/the-blue-puddle-colorados-legislators-v-oil-and-gas/",
