"general_bio":"Emily Noether was born in 1882 in Erlangen, Germany. She attended the University of Erlangen and graduated with an undergraduate degree and PhD in mathematics. However, she originally was barred from going to the University because of her gender. After her graduation, she struggled to find a job in academia. Even though she was plagued with discrimination because of her gender, she became a leading researcher in abstract algebra and symmetry. Her biggest contribution to the field of physics was Noether's Theorem. This work was heavily influenced by her extensive expertise in symmetry and paved the way for modern physics as we know today. After her work developing her theorem, the Nazi�s took over Germany and Nother was of Jewish descent. She immigrated to the United States and taught at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania. She died 18 months after her arrival in the US of complications for surgery at age 53.",

�Noether�s Theorem�: �The Noether�s Theorem is a theorem that says that for every physical system there is a law of symmetry. Many modern physics concepts draw heavily from this theorem.�
