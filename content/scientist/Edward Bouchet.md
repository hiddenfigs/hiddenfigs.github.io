  "general_bio": "Edward Bouchet was the first African American to earn a Ph.D. in physics in the United States and the sixth person overall to receive a Ph.D. in physics from an American university. His dissertation focused on measuring refractive indices in the emerging field of geometrical optics. Despite his academic achievements, racial discrimination prevented him from securing a university teaching position. Instead, he dedicated his career to educating African American students, teaching at the Institute for Colored Youth in Philadelphia for decades. His work significantly impacted the advancement of African American education in the sciences. The American Physical Society confers the Edward A. Bouchet Award annually to recognize physicists from underrepresented communities who have made significant contributions to physics research and the advancement of minority scientists.",
