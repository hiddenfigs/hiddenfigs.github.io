  "general_bio": "Al-Kindi was an Arab polymath active in the Islamic Golden Age. He made significant contributions to various fields, including philosophy, mathematics, medicine, and cryptography. He played a key role in introducing Greek philosophy to the Islamic world and developed early techniques for cryptanalysis. Al-Kindi authored over 260 works, many of which were lost, but his influence persisted through Latin translations. His work laid foundational principles in multiple disciplines, impacting later scholars in both the Islamic world and medieval Europe.",
