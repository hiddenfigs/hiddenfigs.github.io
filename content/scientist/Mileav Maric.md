"general_bio":"Mileva Maric was a Serbian physicist and mathematician, one of the first women to study physics and mathematics at the Zurich Polytechnic. She was a close collaborator and the first wife of Albert Einstein. Her potential contributions to Einstein's early work, particularly the Annus Mirabilis papers, have been a subject of debate. After separating from Einstein, she dedicated herself to raising their children, including their son Eduard, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Maric spent her later years in Zurich, where she died in 1948.",

"Potential contributions to Einstein's early work" : "There is ongoing debate regarding Mileva Maric's potential contributions to Albert Einstein's early work, particularly the Annus Mirabilis papers. Some historians argue that she played a significant collaborative role, citing letters between the couple that suggest intellectual partnership. Others believe her contributions were minimal, attributing the primary work to Einstein alone. Despite the lack of definitive evidence, Maric's potential involvement remains a topic of interest in the history of science, highlighting the challenges faced by women in scientific fields during that era."],
