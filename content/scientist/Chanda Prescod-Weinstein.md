  "general_bio": "Chanda Prescod-Weinstein is a theoretical particle physicist, particle cosmology theorist, theoretical cosmologist, and particle astrophysicist who studies dark matter, with a focus on axions [CITE 1] and asymmetric dark matter [CITE 2], and Black feminist science, technology, and society studies. Prescod-Weinstein completed her dissertation on quantum gravity at the Perimeter Institute and graduated from University of Waterloo with a Ph.D. in 2011. She is currently an Associate Professor of Physics and Core Faculty Member in Women's and Gender Studies at the University of New Hampshire. On June 10, 2020, in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, Prescod-Weinstein and Brian Nord organized a global 'Strike for Black Lives' of over 4,500 academics and organizations including Nature, the American Physical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Institute of Physics. In 2022, she released a bibliography of all the professional publications of US-based Black women+ with PhDs in physics.",
