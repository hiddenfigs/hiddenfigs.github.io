"general_bio":" Ruby Payne Scott was born in New South Wales on May 28th, 1912. She obtained her bachelor's and master's in physics from the University of Sydney. Payne was the third woman to graduate with a physics degree from the institution. Due to the lack of opportunities and jobs for women in the physics field, Payne-Scott became a teacher and worked at Amalgamated Wireless before joining the Australian government’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO). In 1944, she married William Hall. The couple was very progressive and feminist, but Australian law prohibited married women from holding permanent positions in public service. However, Payne-Scott kept her marriage a secret to continue her research. While she was hiding her marriage, she discovered several types of solar flares and solar bursts through radio waves, and she demonstrated that sunspots are associated with increased radio emission from the Sun. Together with scientist Alec Little, she invented the swept-lode interferometer which helped scientists pan the sky for single-wave formations and record movies of solar radio emission. In 1950 it was discovered that she was married, and she was forced to step down from her permanent position. Soon afterwards, she resigned because of the lack of maternity leave. Ruby Payne-Scott returned briefly to radio astronomy to participate in a conference at the University of Sydney in 1952 and later taught at the Danebank School near Sydney for more than a decade. She eventually died from complications of dementia in 1981 at 68 years old. In 2008, CSIRO established the Payne-Scott Award to recognize “researchers returning from family-related career breaks.” The Australian Academy of Science, University of Sydney, and Danebank School also established awards in her honor.",
"key_contributions":{
"Solar Burst and Solar Flares":"Solar flares are bursts of electromagnetic radiation emitted from the Sun due to the interactions of the Sun’s magnetic field with the ionized particles in the Sun’s interior and atmosphere. As observed by Payne-Scott, these flares originate in active regions of the Sun’s atmosphere, which are often visible as sun spots. While solar flares can be associated with all kinds of electromagnetic radiation, solar radio bursts are specifically visible in radio waves.",
"Swept-Lobe Interferometer":"Interferometers use multiple radio antennas to construct very detailed radio images of objects in the sky. For solar astronomy, this method allows us to determine where on the surface of the Sun radio emission is being produced. The swept-lobe interferometer specifically allowed Payne-Scott to measure radio images of the Sun 25 times per second. This produced a detailed view of where the emission came from and how it was changing over time, enabling a better understanding of the physical processes that produce solar variability and magnetic activity in the Sun."},
