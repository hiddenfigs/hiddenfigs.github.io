  "general_bio": "Chien-Shiung Wu was a Chinese-American experimental physicist who made significant contributions in the field of nuclear physics. She is best known for her work on the Manhattan Project and the Wu experiment, which provided critical experimental support for the theory of parity violation in weak nuclear interactions.",
