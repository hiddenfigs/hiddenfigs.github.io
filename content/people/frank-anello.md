  "bio": "I am the cofounder and Executive Director of Project Worthmore :\n\nAs you know, the global refugee crisis is a defining human rights issue of our time. Colorado is no exception, with over 60,000 refugees in the Denver-metro area alone. These individuals and families have fled war, persecution, and violence in their home countries, and they come to the United States with to face a whole new set of challenges.\n\nFounded in 2011 to meet the needs and gaps in assistance for newcomers, Project Worthmore is dedicated to creating a world where every person is valued, included, and empowered.\n\nThrough our community-driven approach, we have developed impactful programs that support refugee families in Colorado:\n\n English Language Classes: Equipping refugees with language skills to foster integration and communication.\n\n Community-Run Food Access Program: Ensuring refugees have access to nutritious food for their well-being.\n\n Organic Urban Farm: Providing fresh produce and vocational opportunities, promoting self-sufficiency.\n\n Comprehensive Care Dental Clinic: Offering affordable dental care, addressing an often overlooked need.\n\n Community Navigators and Language Equity: Assisting refugees in navigating complex systems and overcoming language barriers.",
