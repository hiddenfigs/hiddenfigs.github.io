  "bio": "Notwithstanding my last name and my skin color (white), I grew up in a Hispanic household.  Neither one of my grandmothers spoke English, only Spanish, consequently as the oldest of 5 children, I was expected to be able to talk to my abuelitas.  I learned to speak Spanish before I learned to speak English.  I was the first in my family to graduate from high school, (Longmont, Colorado) college (CU Boulder, graduating cum laude in International Affairs) and law school (University of Texas, Austin).  After law school, I chose not to be drafted, volunteered and was accepted as an officer into the Medical Service Corps, United States Army.  I was stationed in Fort Hood, Texas; Vietnam and Fort Carson.  I attained the rank of Captain. I have practiced law in Colorado Springs since January, 1970 and continue to work full-time.  I have served on numerous non-profit boards to include Esperanza Education Foundation which merged with the Hispanic Education Foundation and became the Foundation for Advancement and Education, legal advisor to El Cinco de Mayo, Inc.; Pikes Peak Community Foundation, Pikes Peak Library District Foundation.  I served on the Vestry of Grace & St. Stephens Episcopal Church and presently am on the HR Committee at Grace.  I am divorced and have 2 adult children, both of whom are college graduates.",
