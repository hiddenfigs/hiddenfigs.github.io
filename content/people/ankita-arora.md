  "bio": "Ankita Arora is a freelance science writer.  As a former international women researcher on a work visa, she has been faced with multiple challenges during her training \u2013 from lack of funding sources, professional development opportunities, and maintaining visa status to fighting with increasing xenophobia. While forging her own path through these bottlenecks, she has grown to appreciate the importance of advocating and the role of policy for science towards developing a better workforce. She is an active member of the early-career researchers science policy group, National Science Policy Network (NSPN), and wishes to become a better advocate for the needs of the underrepresented in STEM. She did her graduate studies at Heidelberg University in Germany.",
