  "bio": "With a Masters in Education, focusing on bilingual pedagogy, I bring a well-rounded perspective to my role as the youngest and only Latina on the Metro Roundtable Water Board. As a Recreation Representative for the Roundtable, I am highly dedicated and effective in advocating for water conservation and recreational activities.\n\nIn addition to my expertise in water conservation, I am also an IDEA Practitioner for NASA, leveraging my knowledge of DEI for their hiring practices. I was honored to serve as this year's Western States Ambassador for Latino Conservation Week, where I continue to inspire and empower community members to connect with nature and become active participants in conservation efforts.\n\nThrough my work as the Colorado Field Coordinator for Hispanics Enjoying Camping, Hunting, and Outdoors (HECHO), I am actively involved in addressing the concerns of Latine and Hispanics in the conservation space. I am committed to bridging the gap and clearing up misconceptions about all things conservation and environmentalism between urban and rural populations of Colorado, and connecting Latines to their elected officials to make changes. My background in education, working in the Globeville Elyria-Swansea area of Denver has informed me directly of what equity causes are of the utmost importance in my city.",
