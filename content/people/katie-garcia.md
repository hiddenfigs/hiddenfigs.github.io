  "bio": "Katie joined 9to5 Colorado in the spring of 2023 to develop campaign messaging and communications strategy. Originally from Abilene, Texas, Katie was raised to push back against injustice and be civically engaged in her community. Katie graduated from Texas A&M University with a degree in Communications and Journalism. After five years in local news, Katie decided to move from an objective position as a reporter to a communication management role in the immigrant rights movement for Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition (CIRC) and CIRC Action Fund. Now, she is stoked to fulfill the 9to5 mission!",
