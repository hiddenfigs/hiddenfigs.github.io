She speaks on some of the most provocative and topical food issues of today, including genetically modified foods, food insecurity, and food production sustainability issues. Aware that divisive and emotional food issues ignite a firestorm of debate she advocates moving from polarizing rhetoric to open and professional courteous discourse. Her goal is to provide science-based information, countering myths and misinformation, and help people create realistic and broad-based  food outlooks which lead to their positive health outcomes and the health of the environment.",
