  "bio": "Dr. Cynthia Trinidad-Sheahan BIO\nDr. Cynthia Trinidad-Sheahan is an advocate, educator, leader and community member whose work has spanned 23 years in Colorado school districts and non-profit organizations. Cynthia's education background began with my B.A. in Elementary and Bilingual Education (University of Northern Colorado), M.A. in Linguistic Development (Colorado University Boulder), Ed.S (Education Specialist) in school leadership and administration (University of Northern Colorado), and her final step of earning her doctorate in Education: Equity Diversity and Inclusion Leadership (University of Colorado Denver) in 2019. Dr. Trinidad-Sheahan's specialty is her professional and personal approach to community engagement and her orientation of multiculturalism that embraces and celebrates individual cultural and linguistic differences. One of Cynthia's key strengths is demonstrated in her comprehension of complex factors when conceptualizing systems that can support linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Cynthia's career has encompassed her passion for not only her family history as a granddaughter of a Mexican immigrant, but also her pride in being the first in her family to graduate from college and receive a doctorate degree. Dr. Cynthia's career focus has been supporting immigrant, refugee and linguistically and culturally diverse families to achieve their educational goals and to reach their personal success.\nDissertation published 2019: Heritage Language Learners on the Brink of Language and Cultural Loss",
