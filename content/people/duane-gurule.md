He has a passion for serving low-income communities and those experiencing food insecurity, stemming from first-hand experience growing up facing many of the barriers and inequities that historically disenfranchise low-income populations.\n\nHe is a co-founder of Small Town Project, which works to improve health equity in Otero and Crowley counties by increasing access to healthy foods and empowering the underserved. Duane also serves his community as Mayor Pro Tem and Council Member for the City of Rocky Ford and on the Advisory Council for Otero College.\n\nAs a first-generation college graduate, Duane holds a B.S. in Computer Information Systems from Metropolitan State University in Denver.
