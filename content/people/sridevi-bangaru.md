  "bio": "Sridevi Bangaru is a Boulder-based musician and performer. She has extensive private and university training in American classical music, musical theater, and contemporary pop/rock. Sridevi has won numerous talent shows, including National Vasavite\u2019s Got Talent Competition, been a featured artist with DJ Prashant, and sang the National Anthem solo at university basketball games. Music and community are everything to her- through performing, she hopes to show AAPI children that they are both American and Asian; and they don\u2019t have to pick one or the other. Sridevi\u2019s dream is to be in an AAPI/BIPOC cover band that performs to empower, uplift, and support our communities.",
